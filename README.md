What does the code do?

This Python code solves a cool math problem! It checks if a list of numbers has a "dominant" number. A dominant number is one that's at least twice as big as every other number in the list. If there's a dominant number, the code tells you where it is in the list. If there isn't, it lets you know by saying "-1".
